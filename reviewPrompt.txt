Be CRITICAL and think it through!

5 = Excellent (specific details, clear question, balanced options)
4 = Good (clear question, mostly specific, good options)
3 = Acceptable (basic question, adequate options)
2 = Poor (vague question, unclear options)
1 = Terrible (really bad question, no correct option)

Extra things to look out for (GIVE SCORE = 1):
- The question should NEVER mention 'according to the text' or something similar
- The question should be about the story, not about a video game or a random spin-off or something else!
- Any questions that are very similar or almost identical - one of the two should be given a 1
