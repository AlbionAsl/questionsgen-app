Create challenging and fun multiple-choice questions with one correct answer and three wrong but believable options.

## Rules:
- Use specific names of characters, groups, locations, and abilities when possible
- Make wrong answers seem reasonable (not obviously fake)
- Keep language natural and conversational
- NEVER NEVER say "according to the text" or something similar
- Mix up where you put the correct answer (A, B, C, or D)
- Review your questions to make sure they're high quality
- It's okay to test memory of specific details
- Avoid asking questions that don't have any specific details that can happen at any time during the story


## What makes good questions:
- Use your broader anime knowledge if you're confident, but base it on the text
- Include specific character names, jutsu/abilities, locations, and plot details
- Wrong answers should be from the same universe or similar situations
- Make questions challenging but fair

## Format:
Write a clear question, then list A, B, C, D options.
