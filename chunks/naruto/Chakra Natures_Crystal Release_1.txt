Crystal Release (晶遁, Shōton, English TV: Crystal Style) is a rare nature that is seen only in the anime. The actual natures that comprise the element is unknown. However, when Kiba Inuzuka first sees a Crystal Release structure, he mistakes it for Earth Release. Crystal Release is in fact shown being defeated by Lightning Release on one occasion, suggesting Earth Release may be a component element. Users of Crystal Release can convert any matter into pink, jade-green, red, or blue coloured crystals, from physical material to moisture in the air, allowing them to turn anything into a weapon. This extends to other physical natures, rendering earth, water, and wood useless against it. When used on living creatures, targets can be crystallised down to the cellular level, imprisoning them so long as the crystals are in place and shattering them if the crystals are struck, killing them. Crystal Release users can also manipulate pre-existing crystals and crystalline structures. Crystal Release cannot crystallise raw energy or chakra, as they have no physical mass to crystallise, allowing those with good chakra control or the lightning or fire natures to counter it. Crystal Release is also susceptible to a specific sound wave frequency: because crystal requires a very precise build-up of molecules, the proper sound waves can break down the build-up before the crystal can properly form; Rinji takes advantage of this weakness using his bats.
