Dust Release (塵遁, Jinton, Viz: Particle Style) is a nature transformation kekkei tōta, a combination of earth, wind, and fire. To perform Dust Release, users form a small three-dimensional object (e.g. a cube, a cone, etc.) out of chakra in their hands. The object expands once released by the user and moves astonishingly fast at its target; anything that passes through it (or that is passed through by it) is disintegrated on a molecular level. Because of the sheer destructiveness of Dust Release, its users are usually unmatched in a fight and they can easily fend off countless enemies. For this reason, the best way to combat one Dust Release user is with a second Dust Release user. Dust Release techniques seem to require a certain amount of preparation time, making it possible to prematurely halt the technique before it is completed. The hands also play a crucial role in the preparation, so interfering with the user's arms can hinder the technique. Dust Release techniques seem to be rather chakra-taxing. Trivia Dust Release is the only known nature transformation to be a combination of more than two other already existing nature transformations. It is also the only known example of a Kekkei Tōta. Ōnoki stated that Mū passed the secrets of Dust Release on to him, possibly suggesting that these techniques are not genetic. Kū and Kakō, both fabrications who were created with Ōnoki as their genetic template, were able to use Dust Release. Dust Release shares the same romanisation as Swift Release. The kanji for "dust" (塵) also appears in the word for particle, atom, or little piece (微塵, mijin, Literally meaning: minute dust). Additionally, the on-reading jin can refer to "one-billionth" (10−9) as well as the Buddhist term for defilement, impurity, or affliction.
