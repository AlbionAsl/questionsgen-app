SoryÅ« Shiki?) from Keizo, he singlehandedly annihilated 67 trained adult swordsmen with his bare fists, to the point where Muzan initially thought it was a demon who had killed all these men. Upon becoming a demon, his combat prowess only grew, eventually earning him the title of Upper Rank Three among the Twelve Kizuki, despite his growth rate being hindered by his refusal to eat women. Akaza was able to fight on par with the Flame Hashira Kyojuro Rengoku and kill him, and had also claimed the lives of numerous other Hashira and Demon Slayers in the past. Akaza displayed remarkable skill by engaging in combat with both the Water Hashira Giyu Tomioka and the Hashira-level Demon Slayer Tanjiro Kamado simultaneously. Despite being outnumbered and facing opponents utilizing their Demon Slayer Marks, Akaza dominated the majority of their battle. He only succumbed to them once Tanjiro accessed the Selfless State and Transparent World. Even though Akaza was unable to defeat Kokushibo when challenging him for the position of Upper Rank One, Kokushibo spared his life despite having killed all other demons who've challenged him in the past, finding the challenge entertaining. This suggests that Akaza was able to put up a good fight against Kokushibo, despite the significant power gap between the two.

Demon Abilities Akaza instantly regrowing his arms moments after they were sliced off. Immense Regeneration: As Upper Rank Three, Akaza possessed one of the most extraordinary regenerative abilities as a result of assimilating a massive amount of Muzan's blood, giving him the capacity to instantly recover from both minor and severe slash wounds, and even regenerate lost limbs with minimal effort. During his intense battle against Giyu and Tanjiro, his regenerative powers reached new heights. Despite having his head cut off by a Nichirin Sword, he miraculously survived and grew a new head afterward, a feat typically thought impossible for demons aside from Muzan Kibutsuji. Even without a head, Akaza's regeneration speed remained nigh-instantaneous. Additionally, he seemingly had precise control over his own regeneration speed, as evident when he intentionally
