Chuni Chuni no Mi. When Shirotsu's transformation was complete, Yehudi gave him a black cloak, and considered him a member of the Super Marines. When the Straw Hats launched an assault on the Super Marines, Yehudi set the powered-up Shirotsu on Luffy. However, Kuroba was able to wake the boy from his stupor, and Yehudi angrily attacked the two boys, claiming that friendship is a waste of time. He was stopped by Luffy, and Yehudi reclaimed the boost he had given to Shirotsu to power himself up instead. Yehudi and Luffy fought as the Straw Hats battled the Super Marines, and Luffy was soon joined by Zoro. The two pirates attacked Yehudi together, defeating him in a flash of fire; when the smoke cleared, Yehudi was gone. Elsewhere on the island, Yehudi cursed the Straw Hats, promising to catch them. To Yehudi's shock, he was interrupted by Kuzan, who arrived to fulfill the promise they made as Marines. While Yehudi accused Kuzan of breaking their promise first, Kuzan simply froze him with Ice Time, leaving him on the island. Trivia Yehudi is likely named after the American-born violinist and conductor Yehudi Menuhin. Yehudi Menuhin played the Soil Stradivarius violin, while Yehudi confronts the Straw Hat Pirates on Soil Island.
