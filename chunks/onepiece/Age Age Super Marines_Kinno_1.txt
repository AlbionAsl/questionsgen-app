He is fairly skilled at using, and was able to easily battle a weakened Roronoa Zoro, though he ultimately lost. History One Piece Premier Show 2022 Kinno was present on Soil Island when the Straw Hat Pirates landed on the island, and reported it to Narcy so that Yehudi would be informed. He later participated in the attack and capturing of Jinbe, and joined the Age Age Super Marines when they confronted the rest of the Straw Hats. After Zoro was weakened by Yehudi, Kinno easily defeated, knocking him to the ground, but Zoro escaped into a nearby river. When the rest of the Super Marines retreated, Kinno went with them. Later, Kinno was challenged by Zoro again, who was still weakened. While Kinno was initially able to continually push Zoro back, the arrival of Dracule Mihawk and thoughts about Zoro's childhood friend motivated the pirate, and Kinno was defeated. Trivia His name may be derived from the Japanese word "nokin" (脳筋?), meaning "muscle-brain."
