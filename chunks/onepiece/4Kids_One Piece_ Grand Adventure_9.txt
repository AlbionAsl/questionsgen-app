bonus condition during her battle, making her the only character whose recruitment on Adventure Mode depends on specific conditions instead of a simple accomplished battle. There is a glitch in the American port where Zoro's "Rising Phoenix" and Zeff's "Red Foot Shock" super attacks, with a high buff in the "Super" stat, can one-shot the enemy if done in specific ways: for Zoro's attack, it needs to be done when the enemy's invencibility frames are about to fade, and for Zeff's attack, it needs to be executed to a particular distance, so the very end of the shockwave hits the enemy when the attack is about to end. In the European port, Sanji's "Rotisserie" super attack is nerfed to the point that it needs almost instant proximity to deal decent damage compared to the American port. Additionally, Buggy's secret attack deals no damage due to a glitch in the European version.
